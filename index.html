<h2>Keywords</h2>
<p>
Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Robotics, Natural Language Processing, Physical Computing, and Web Development.
</p>

<h2>Textual Entailment</h2>
<p>
Textual Entailment is the NLP task of determining whether the meaning of a given text passage entails that of another. Textual Entailment is a fundamental problem in natural language understanding which requires the ability to abstract over the inherent syntactic and semantic variability in natural language. 
</p>
<p>
My work for CCG is based on the Textual Entailment Task in Natural Language Processing (NLP); I am investigating aspects of numeric and temporal reasoning in regard to this task.
</p>

<h2>Statistical Relational Learning</h2>
<p>
Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) is an emerging subdiscipline of Machine Learning concerned with building statistical models of domains with <i>relational structure</i>, meaning the domains of interest are composed of both statistically dependent and independent objects, i.e. the typical independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption made in statistics and machine learning is no longer present in relational domains.
</p>
<p>
The motivations of SRL are many, but boil down to a few pillars:

<ul>
<li><p>Real-world problems violate the i.i.d. assumption typically made in statistical methods because objects in the world are related.</p></li>
<li><p>When we don't model the dependence between data instances, we often throw out valuable information. Hence, exploiting relationships amongst objects can lead to greater predictive accuracy in computational models and better understanding of the domain, at the costs of greater modeling, computational, and sample complexity.</p></li>
<li><p>SRL offers a growth plan for machine learning, allowing researchers to model bigger problems.</p></li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
The most enticing of these three is definitely the later, there appears to be a heavy shift in the direction of learning structured output: learning is no longer classify single feature vectors, but entire structures. Examples of such domains include hyper-linked document classification, medical diagnosis, semantic role labeling, and social network analysis.
</p>

<h2>Reinforcement Learning</h2>
<p>
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a protocol for learning to make decisions within an environment based on rewards and punishment. The objective of these interactions is to learn a policy (i.e., a mapping from states to actions), which maximizes the expected accumulated reward over time. RL distinguishes itself from Supervised Learning in that agents must learn from the consequences of their actions, rather than being explicitly taught. This gives rise to the problem of assigning credit or blame to a single action for the performance of the entire policy.
</p>
<p>
Although RL techniques have elegant theoretical / mathematical foundations, applying these techniques to problems with large state spaces such as robot control has proven to be quite difficult. Generally, I am interested in taking RL to big domains where the agent cannot, in any reasonable amount of time, explore the entire state space (or even a reasonable fraction of it). An example of such a domain is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris">Tetris</a> (roughly 10^60 states), which was the subject of my undergraduate thesis. What I find interesting about Tetris is that despite it's enormous state space, humans can play the game very well. I believe this is because they can establish important high-level concepts, such as, a line or a hole, from only playing the game for a few minutes. Thus, in order to create an effective Tetris agent it is necessary to inform the agent of these concepts rather than have the agent learn to play Tetris from a blank slate.
</p>
<p>
I am also interested in applications of reinforcement learning which require agents to generalize what they have learned from one task to a new one which is very similar. In most applications of reinforcement learning, policies learned are very specific to a single task and cannot be applied to a new task no matter how similar it may be. Currently, I am working on having a simulated aircraft do skywriting. Skywriting poses an interesting challenge: the airplane controller/planner clearly cannot train on all possibly phrases which it will eventually see -- How can we break the problem up into smaller pieces and then combine them in a fashion which will allow the the airplane to write anything? Simply learning each letter independently is one option, but is inefficient and does not in anyway aid us in learning to write in Chinese.
</p>

<h2>Robotics and Physical Computing</h2>
<p>
I have recently resurrected a childhood dream of building robots and embedded devices. As far as I can remember, I have always taken apart my toys and tried to stick them together. Now that I am 23 years old, I finally have money, knowledge, and patience to build such systems. I have been following the <a href="http://www.makezine.com">Make Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.hackaday.com">Hack-a-Day</a>, etc. communities pretty closely and have picked up a few projects; including: <em>RouterBot</em> a wirelessly controlled robot which is essentially a wireless router which can control servos; Wii Nunchuck controlled servo; and <a href="http://arduino.cc">Arduino</a> programming. I am currently working on controlling the robot with the Nunchuck and adding some autonomous behavior and sensing abilities (hopefully vision). Back in high school, I was very interested in custom cars. I have some experience with hydraulic suspension, auto repair, and car audio (check out the Miscellaneous section for more details) maybe I can find a place for this knowledge in a robot (Big Dog has hydraulic-powered legs).

					<h3>Routerbot</h3>
					A Routerbot is a robot which uses a Wifi router (Linksys WRT54GL) as both an communication 
					means and an onboard computer. Many people do not know that a router is actually a simple computer 
					capable of running an operating system, executing  programs, and serial port communication. 
					Thanks to <a href="http://andrey.mikhalchuk.com">Andrey Mikhalchuk</a>'s 
					<a href="http://robostuff.com/diy-projects/routerbot">tutorial</a>, the project is well 
					under way. Those interested in Routerbots should check out

		<div class="accordion_content">

<p>
Throughout my undergraduate years, I spent much of my time as a teaching assistant. Here is a breakdown of the courses that I have been involved with:
</p>
<p>
<em>Foundations of Data Science</em>: I was the assistant for a course on the fundamentals of Information Science for the Multimodal Information Access and Synthesis Summer Institute where both graduate and undergraduates are exposed to the a variety of topics including Statistical Inference, Information Theory, and Machine Learning. I was very involved in the development of the curriculum and the course content. I gave a few lectures and I was in charge of a hands-on lab session where students recreated several projects which I made up when I took the class.
</p>
<p>
<em>Discrete Structures</em>: I was an undergraduate teaching assistant for a discrete math course for three semesters. In this course, students are introduced to the fundamental discrete mathematical structures encountered in the study of Computer Science. Topics include: sets, propositions, boolean algebra, induction, recursion, relations, functions, and graphs. Since this is one of the first computer science courses a student at the U of I take, I tried my best to make the mathematical side of computer science less intimidating.
</p>
<p>
<em>Introduction to Programming: A Multimedia Approach</em>: I was the course assistant for an introduction to programming course (in <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>), where students learn the elementary principles of object-oriented programming. The goal of the class is to teach programming with non-technical focus, hence we focus on fun applications of programming such as games and image processing.

					<h3>Cars</h3>
					I often find myself in a situation where people do not believe me when I tell them about my old cars. 
					So, I found to video sitting on an old external hard drive to prove my point. Also, I received the Senior 
					Superlative of "Best Car of the Senior Class" at American Heritage School in 2004 (maybe I should scan 
					the yearbook page). I'm not sure which car got me the award. I wish I documented my adventures in customizing 
					these two cars, but I'm sorry to say that this is the extent of the documentation I have.

					<ul>
						<li>
						  <p>My first car (<a title="My bouncing '84 Fifth Ave." 
												params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" 
												class="lightwindow page-options" 
												href="http://www.youtube.com/v/iIXSJnfQK68&hl=en&fs=1&" 
												rel="">video</a>) - a gorgeous 1984 
							Chrysler Fifth Avenue with red velvet interior, purchased for a mere $900. I installed the hydraulics 
							myself, a non-trivial task -- the fifth ave has torsion bar suspension and short A-Arms.</p>
						</li>
	
						<li><p>My Second car (<a title="The Big Bad Baby Blue Buick" 
												params="lightwindow_width=425,lightwindow_height=340,lightwindow_loading_animation=false" 
												class="lightwindow page-options" 
												href="http://www.youtube.com/v/HDZezucXcZg&hl=en&fs=1&"
												rel="">video</a>) - "The Big Bad Baby  Blue Buick" the hydraulics are on the 
							back of this one, you can't tell in this video, but the car was scrapping the ground a bit.</p></li>
					</ul>

					The videos don't show any of the great stuff on the interior, such as train air-horn, fog machine, 
					the 1466 Watts of stereo power, television and Playstation 2, various neon lights, or the custom dashboard. 
					It definitely does not show the cracked chassis that I had to welded back together or the water pump, 
					alternator, starter motor, and carburetor my dad and I fixed. Working on these cars was an invaluable 
					learning experience and a load of fun.

					<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1zkGr85um4">video 2</a>). This is how I spent all of my free 
					time for about 3 years. I guess you could say that I learned programming because of it! I started off 
					making webpages and flash applications to host my pictures, video, and bio; eventually leading me to 
					take an extra-curricular <a href="http://www.eimacs.com/">computer science course</a> (Scheme <3).
